# crypto-portfolio-tracker
A small project using Brownie to simulate a blockchain environment with 5 wallets, each of which are allocated random crypto holdings. The app then loads up-to-date price info and visualizes each portfolio with a simple gui, it also does a simple (not very accurate) forecasting with a simple julia linear regressor model.


## Look at the README inside project folder for a more detailed description of the project and how to use it.
